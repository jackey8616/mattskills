## What it does

`implement` builds the work described in a spec or a set of tickets — driving it through test-driven development, typechecking, and the full test suite, then handing off to review and committing to the current branch.

It does **not** decide what to build. The spec is already settled and the seams are already agreed; `implement` executes that plan rather than reopening it. It is the hands, not the head — the thinking happened upstream.

## When to reach for it

You invoke this by typing `/implement` — the agent won't reach for it on its own.

Reach for it once the work is written down as a spec or split into tickets and you're ready to turn that into code. If the spec doesn't exist yet, write it first — for that, use [to-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec), or [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets) to break a spec into tickets. If you just want to build something test-first without a full spec, drop to [tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd) directly.

## Pre-agreed seams

The idea `implement` runs on is the **seam** — the stable interface a feature is tested at, chosen before any code is written. It doesn't invent seams mid-build; it uses the ones already picked (during [to-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec)) and writes tests against them via [tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd). Working at pre-agreed seams is what keeps the implementation honest: the tests target something durable, so the code underneath can move without the tests moving.

Around that core it keeps the loop tight — typecheck often, run single test files as it goes, run the whole suite once at the end — then closes out with a review pass and a commit to the current branch.

## One ticket, and the box it ticks

`implement` builds the requirements **its ticket** covers, not the whole change. When the ticket names an OpenSpec change it reads that change's proposal and delta specs first, then stays inside its slice — building ahead is how a tracer bullet stops being one. Scope it discovers that the delta specs don't cover doesn't get absorbed; it stops and says so, and that scope goes back through propose.

The last step is the one that's easy to forget and expensive to skip: **tick the ticket's box in `tasks.md`**. [change-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-change-review) reads those ticks to decide the change is ready to archive, so a box nobody ticked stalls the whole change even though the work has already shipped.

## Where it fits

`implement` is the build step near the end of the main chain, just before the review:

```txt
grill-with-docs → to-spec → to-tickets → implement → code-review → change-review
```

Reach for it after the work has been specced and sequenced, not before — one fresh session per ticket. Its key neighbours are [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets), which produces the tickets — each declaring its blocking edges — that it works through, and [tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd), which it drives internally to write the tests at each seam before running its own [code-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review) pass and committing. Once every ticket is built and ticked, [change-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-change-review) closes the change out. When you're unsure which skill or flow fits, [ask-matt](https://aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt) routes you.
